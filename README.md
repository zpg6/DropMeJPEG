# DropMeJPEG

MacOS Menu Bar App to automatically convert AirDrop'd `.heic` images to `.jpeg`. It's as simple as opening the app and sending yourself some images via AirDrop. This was a feature I've been wanting, so I built it myself.

The alternative for me has been to open the `.heic` image in **Preview app** and then export it as a `.jpeg`. As of a recent MacOS update, you can open the image in Finder and right-click to convert it to JPEG.
